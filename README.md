## What are you going to make?
We're going to make a remote controlled car with a lot of focus being put on using a mobile application with a nice UI and a bluetooth connection. The application will allow for a camera feed, forwards and backwards driving, speed control, and also turning 360 degrees. Lastly, as a bonus feature that we will hopefully have time for, we want to try to use short voice commands to activate, stop, and control the car in different ways. 

## Why will you make it?
Our main goal with the product is to try and provide a device that could be used for scouting and other tactical purposes in combat or rescue environments where itâ€™s either too dangerous, or too small of a space for an actual person to enter. 

## How are you going to make it?
We are already provided with a car to use, alongside an arduino and our own mobile phones. The camera feed will be provided through a GoPro which is intended to be fitted onto the cars front, which is then interfaced with the applications user interface. Using voice to text technology from open-source libraries, we can convert voice-lines into strings that help the car recognize simple commands to make it perform different actions. This will be done as a feature in the application.
