## What are you going to make?
We're going to make a remote controlled car with a lot of focus being put on using a web-application hosted on the Raspberry Pi with a nice UI. The application will allow for a camera feed, forwards and backwards driving, speed control, and also turning 360 degrees.

## Why will you make it?
Our main goal with the product is to try and provide a device that could be used for scouting and other tactical purposes in combat or rescue environments where it’s either too dangerous, or too small of a space for an actual person to enter. 

## How are you going to make it?
We are already provided with a car to use, alongside an arduino and our own web-connected devices. The camera feed will be provided through a Raspberry Pi Camera V2 which is intended to be fitted onto the cars front, which is then interfaced with the web application which is hosted on a Raspberry Pi.
